define help

Supported targets: prepare, develop, sdist, clean, test, and pypi.

The 'prepare' target installs this project's build requirements into the current virtualenv.

The 'develop' target creates an editable install of this project and its runtime requirements in the
current virtualenv. The install is called 'editable' because changes to the source code
immediately affect the virtualenv.

The 'clean' target undoes the effect of 'develop'.

The 'pypi' target publishes the current commit of this project to PyPI after enforcing that the working
copy and the index are clean, and tagging it as an unstable .dev build.
