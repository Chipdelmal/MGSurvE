Installation
=====

It is strongly recommended to install and use `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ for environment management, as some of MGSurvE's dependencies might clash with specific packages versions.
These installation instructions assume `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ is already installed in the target system.


Local Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uneventful (tested on Linux)
--------------------------

Create a clean :code:`python=3.9` environment:


.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n MGSurvE python="3.9" -y



Activate the environment, and install MGSurvE using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   conda activate MGSurvE
   pip install MGSurvE


If this ran correctly, try importing the package from the terminal with:

.. code-block:: console

   python
   import MGSurvE as srv


If `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_ or `libpysal <https://pysal.org/libpysal/>`_ are not currently installed, we will get a warning that we can safely ignore (see the next section for more info); but if any of these steps resulted in an error, let's have a look at the next section in this installation guide.


Additional Dependencies, and Installation Mishaps (sometimes happens on MacOS)
--------------------------


Sometimes, either `DEAP <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, `libpysal <https://pysal.org/libpysal/>`_, or `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_ decide not to play nicely.
For these cases, the following procedure might help.


In a fresh environment on :code:`python=3.9` (or one in which the installation of MGSurvE failed), run the following commands to install `DEAP <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_:


.. code-block:: console

   conda install deap -y


With this package installed, we can proceed and install MGSurvE:


.. code-block:: console

   pip install MGSurvE

which should be enough to get us started.



Finally, let's install `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html>`_ (for geo-features plotting), and `libpysal <https://pysal.org/libpysal/>`_ (to generate poisson-distributed pointsets). 
The easiest way to install these dependencies is through `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_:


.. code-block:: console

   conda install cartopy -y
   conda install libpysal -y


   
If this installation fails, or if :code:`import MGSurvE` fails on python, we might need to have a look at the next section.


Bulletproof Installation Method
--------------------------

If either of these approaches is failing, try the following chain of commands:


.. code-block:: console

   conda create -n MGSurvE python="3.10"
   conda activate MGSurvE
   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install -c conda-forge deap -y
   conda install -c conda-forge libpysal -y
   conda install -c conda-forge cartopy -y
   pip install MGSurvE


In case this method still fails, please have a look at the installation instructions on: `DEAP <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html>`_, `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/installing.html>`_, and `libpysal <https://pysal.org/libpysal/installation.html>`_; before installing MGSurvE.


Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An alternative way to get `MGSurvE <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ running is to download the latest `Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/chipdelmal/mgsurve>`_.

To get started with this approach, `install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ on your system. Then, go to our `Docker image hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/chipdelmal/mgsurve>`_ and get the latest tag to pull from it. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   docker pull chipdelmal/mgsurve:0.6.5.5


And then run it in interactive mode:

.. code-block:: console

   docker run -it chipdelmal/mgsurve:0.6.5.5 bash


We can check that `MGSurvE <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ is correctly installed with its dependencies by running:

.. code-block:: console

   python
   import MGSurvE

Which should run without any error or warnings. To quit our python session, we simply type :code:`exit()` into the interpreter, and we exit the docker promt by typing :code:`exit`.
