Future 
=====================

We are currently working in developing some extensions to our base package. Some of the main lines of research we are considering for the near future are the following.


Banning Sites
--------------

A simple extension to the discrete optimization case, we will be adding the option to set a group of sites that are not to be taken into account for optimization purposes.
This extension is meant to provide with a way to setup households or populations that are not willing to lay a trap within their property but that need to be taken into account as possible sites which mosquitoes can traverse.


Surveillance Routing
---------------------

Another direction in which we will be moving in the near future is the co-optimization of traps positions along with the routes for field people to check up on traps.
In this application, we will be looking into combining the time to detection fitness function with the time it takes for vehicles to visit the traps in the landscape so that we are able to minimize the time to detection whilst taking into account the routing cost of surveillance.

Optimizing Trap Number and Types
-----------------------------------

One final avenue of research we are interested in is the optimization of the number of deployed traps and their type.
This application would take into account the cost of the traps and be able to select the traps that would need to be deployed to keep time to detection and cost as low as possible.
