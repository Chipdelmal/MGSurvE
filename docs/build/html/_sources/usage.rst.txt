Usage
=====

Installation
------------

To use MGSurvE, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install MGSurvE

If needed, dependencies can be installed through our conda environment through its YML:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda env create -f REQUIREMENTS.yml


or TXT definitions:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda create -n new MGSurvE --file REQUIREMENTS.txt


Example
------------

Let's create a simple landscape with three sites, and two traps.

First, we load the required libraries:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import MGSurvE as srv


and lay down the points at coordinates :code:`((0, 0), (2, 0.5), (2.5, 1.5))` with the same point-type :code:`0`. 
This is done by creating a pandas dataframe with column names :code:`('x', 'y', 't')`:

.. code-block:: python

   pts = (
      (0.0, 0.0, 0), 
      (2.0, 0.5, 0), 
      (2.5, 1.5, 0),
   )
   points = pd.DataFrame(pts, columns=('x', 'y', 't'))

To add the traps, we follow a similar process, with the addition of the kernel shape function:

.. code-block:: python

   trp = (
      (2.0, 2.0, 0),
      (1.0, 3.0, 0)
   )
   traps = pd.DataFrame(trp, columns=('x', 'y', 't'))
   tKernels = {
      0: {'kernel': srv.exponentialDecay, 'params': {'A': 0.5, 'b': 2}}
   }

Once with this information, we can generate our landscape instance:

.. code-block:: python

   lnd = srv.Landscape(
      points, 
      traps=traps, trapsKernels=tKernels
   )

And that's it. We have successfully created our basic landscape.
