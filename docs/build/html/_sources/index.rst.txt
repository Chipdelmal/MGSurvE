Features
------------

`MGSurvE <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ aims to be a fairly flexible utility that serves as a tool to compare and contrast effectiveness of trapping schemes in a variety of situations.
To this end, we have integrated the following features into our package (with more coming in future updates):

* Support for different point-types
* Random point-process landscape generators
* Customizable movement kernels
* Different movement kernels for male and female mosquitos
* Customizable trap attractiveness kernels
* Different attractiveness levels at specific point-type transitions
* Different trap attractiveness levels for male and female mosquitos
* Immovable traps
* Integrated plotting routines
* Integrated Map-plotting routines
* GA optimization routines integration
