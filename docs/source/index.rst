MGSurvE's documentation!
===================================

`MGSurvE <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ is a python package designed to optimize the location of mosquito traps in complex spatially-heterogeneous environments.
Have a look at our `github <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ repo for the latest code or `install <./installation.html>`_  our package through `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/MGSurvE/>`_.

Our `tutorials <demos.html>`_ sections contains several use-case examples!

Features
------------

`MGSurvE <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE>`_ aims to be a fairly flexible utility that serves as a tool to compare and contrast effectiveness of trapping schemes in a variety of situations.
To this end, we have integrated the following features into our package (with more coming in future updates):

* Support for different point-types
* Random point-process landscape generators
* Customizable movement kernels
* Different movement kernels for male and female mosquitos
* Customizable trap attractiveness kernels
* Different attractiveness levels at specific point-type transitions
* Different trap attractiveness levels for male and female mosquitos
* Immovable traps
* Integrated plotting routines
* Integrated Map-plotting routines (for GIS geometries)
* Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) routines integration
* Attractiveness/repellency effects
* Docker images



Demos
------------



Have a look at our `tutorials <./demos.html>`_ and `upcoming webinar <https://github.com/Chipdelmal/MGSurvE_Webinar2023>`_ for more demonstrations and materials on how to get started with our software!
